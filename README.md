We created a database of over 70,000 shark images covering 219 species of sharks. The Shark Detector (SD) is an open source package designed to identify sharks from visual media and classify 47 species with 70% accuracy using transfer learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Models and Data

The SD is composed of an object-detection model, Shark Locator (SL), and multiple image classifiers packaged into the Shark Classifier (SC). The Shark Identifier (SI) is a binary classification scheme which is more tailored to big data mining.
1) Shark Locator (SL) -- object-detection
2) Genus-specific classifier (GSC) -- image classifier (parent node)
3) Species-specific classifier (SSCg) -- image classifier (child node of genus)

We developed the SC as a hierarchical framework for taxonomically classifying located shark images. We trained one genus-specific model and a series of local species-specific models - one for each genus. The SC ingests the filtered shark images and classifies them at the genus level with the genus-specific classifier (GSC). Then, depending on the genus, a species-specific classifier (SSCg) will predict the most likely species. For the GSC, we trained 45,101 images across 26 genus classes. We trained 18 SSCg models with 24,391 images. The SC and SI models are continusously trained as new images are ingested.

## Code
This model implements the Keras package with a Tensorflow backend entirely in Python.  

### Requires
- [Python 3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Tensorflow 2.9.2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Keras 2.9.0](https://keras.io/)
- [PIL 9.1.1](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [OpenCV 4.7.0.72](https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python)
- [pandas 1.2.3](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [numpy 1.22.3](https://www.numpy.org)

The SD works best with GPU acceleration 
- CUDA version 11.0 
- NVIDIA driver 450.51.05

# Installation
Follow these instructions to install and run the Shark Detector application: 
### Mac / Linux
1. CLONE the repository and create your Python environment 
```
git clone https://github.com/JeremyFJ/Shark-Detector.git
cd Shark-Detector
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. DOWNLOAD the file **models** from [models](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeremyjer/sharkdetector) (~5GB)
3. EXTRACT and MOVE your **models** to your cloned repository
4. Run the SD on a test video 
```
python sd_bruv.py
```
5. Detection frames to `detvid/` and spreadsheet to `data/`

## Run
This repository currently instructs on how to detect and classify shark species from videos and images

See [sharkPulse](http://sharkpulse.cnre.vt.edu/can-you-find-a-shark/) to classify single images

- `sd_img.py` detects and classifies sharks from a batch of images. Add your images to `www/images/`
- `sd_bruv.py` detects and classifies sharks from videos (typically baited remote underwater videos, however all videos suspected to contain shark subjects can be processed). Add your videos to `www/videos/` or change the code to specify a directory and if to process one video or a batch (default is batch processing). 

## Results
A spreadsheet is saved to `data/` for each video or a batch of images

When processing videos, positive detections are stored in `detvid/`. When processing image batches, positive detections are saved to `detimages/`.
